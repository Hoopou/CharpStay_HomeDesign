[ ] The design must be adaptable to any device size

[ ] The navbar of the page must be made in the app.component.html, located at `src/app/containers` of the app

[ ] You must use the provided `property-preview` component located at `src/app/modules/home/components` for the `Recomended Deals` section of your home page since the data will be dynamically entered later on. 

[ ] You must create global variables in the `src/styles.scss` file for every style that we are probably are going to use on the website later on. For example: the color of the button should have its own property. 

[ ] For now, you can take place-holder images.
